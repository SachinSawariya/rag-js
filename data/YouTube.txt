YouTube
YouTube is an American social media and online
video sharing platform owned by Google. YouTube
was founded on February 14, 2005,[7] by Chad Hurley,
Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen, who were former
employees of PayPal. Headquartered in San Bruno,
California, it is the second-most-visited website in the
world, after Google. In January 2024, YouTube had
more than 2.7 billion monthly active users, who
collectively watched more than one billion hours of
videos every day.[8] As of May 2019, videos were
being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than
500 hours of content per minute,[9][10] and as of mid2024, there were approximately 14.8 billion videos in
total.[11]

On November 13, 2006, YouTube was purchased by
Google for US$1.65 billion (equivalent to $2.39 billion
in 2024).[12] Google expanded YouTube's business
model from generating revenue through advertisements
alone to offering paid content such as movies and
exclusive content explicitly produced for YouTube. It
also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription
option for watching content without ads. YouTube
incorporated the Google AdSense program, generating
more revenue for both YouTube and approved content
creators. In 2023, YouTube's advertising revenue
totaled $31.7 billion, a 2% increase from the
$31.1 billion reported in 2022.[13] From Q4 2023 to Q3
2024, YouTube's combined revenue from advertising
and subscriptions exceeded $50 billion.[14]

YouTube has had unprecedented social impact,
influencing popular culture, internet trends, and
creating multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth
and success, the platform has been criticized for its
facilitation of the spread of misinformation and
copyrighted content, routinely violating its users'
privacy, excessive censorship, endangering the safety
of children and their well-being, and for its
inconsistent implementation of platform guidelines.

History
Founding and initial growth (2005–
2006)
YouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim,
and Steve Chen. The three were early employees at
PayPal and had become wealthy after eBay's
acquisition of the company.[15] Hurley had studied
design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and
Chen and Karim studied computer science together at
the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[16]
According to a story that has often been repeated in the
media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for
YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they
had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been
shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San
Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied
that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea
that YouTube was founded after a dinner party "was
probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around
creating a story that was very digestible".[17]

Karim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy
when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim
could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami online, which led to
the idea of a video-sharing site.[18][19] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a
video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[17][20] They

created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in
exchange for a $100 reward.[21] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with
the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[22]
YouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology
startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the
company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia
Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest

www.youtube.com.[25] The first video was uploaded on
April 23, 2005. Titled "Me at the zoo", it shows co-founder
Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[26][27] The same day, the company
launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach
one million total views.[28][29] The site exited beta in December 2005, by which time the site was
receiving 8 million views a day.[30][31] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30
seconds of footage.[32]
YouTube was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was founded in November 2004,
though that site remained a side project of its developers from CollegeHumor.[33] On December 17, 2005
—the same week YouTube exited beta—NBCUniversal Saturday Night Live ran a sketch "Lazy Sunday"
by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for Saturday Night
Live, "Lazy Sunday"'s status as an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important website.[34]
Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February
2006 before they were removed when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright
concerns.[35] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize
YouTube's reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[36][37] The site grew rapidly; in July
2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that
the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[38]
The choice of the name youtube.com led to problems for a similarly named website, utube.com.
That site's owner, Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment (Universal Tube), filed a lawsuit against
YouTube in November 2006, after being regularly overloaded by people looking for YouTube. Universal
Tube subsequently changed its website to www.utubeonline.com.[39][40][41]

"Broadcast Yourself" era (2006–2013)
On October 9, 2006, Google announced that they had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google
stock.[42][43] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.[44][45] Google's acquisition launched
newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the
content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[33] It was at this time that YouTube adopted the
slogan "Broadcast Yourself". The company experienced rapid growth. The Daily Telegraph wrote that in
2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[46] By 2010, the company
had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to
comScore.[47] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on
the site.[48]

In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos
uploaded every minute.[49][50][51] Most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos;
according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[52]
That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a
darker shade of red.[53][54] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across
desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013.[55] By that point, more than 100 hours were being
uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014.[56][57]
During that time, the company also went through some
organizational changes. In October 2006, YouTube moved to
a new office in San Bruno, California.[58] Hurley announced
that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of
YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar
would take over as head of the company in October 2010.[59]
In April 2009, YouTube partnered with Vevo.[60] In April
2010, Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" became the most-viewed
video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million views on
May 9, 2010.[61]

YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno,
California, April 2017

YouTube faced a major lawsuit by Viacom International in 2011 that nearly resulted in the
discontinuation of the website. The lawsuit was filed due to alleged copyright infringement of Viacom's
material by YouTube. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that
YouTube was not liable, and thus YouTube won the case in 2012.[62]

Susan Wojcicki's leadership (2014–2023)
Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February
2014.[63] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its
headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for
$215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres
(554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800
employees.[64] YouTube officially launched the "polymer"
YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017
redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design
language as its default, as well as a redesigned logo that is
built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[65]
Through this period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond advertisements. In
2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content providers to offer premium, subscription-based
channels.[66][67] This effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with US$4.99
channel subscriptions.[68][69] These channel subscriptions complemented the existing Super Chat ability,
launched in 2017, which allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment
highlighted.[70] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known as "Music Key", which
bundled ad-free streaming of music content on YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[71]
The service continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new premium service
that would offer ad-free access to all content on the platform (succeeding the Music Key service released

the previous year), premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as well as
background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also released YouTube Music, a third app
oriented towards streaming and discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube platform.[72][73][74]
The company also attempted to create products appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile
app known as YouTube Kids in 2015, which was designed to provide an experience optimized for
children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-appropriate
content, and parental control features.[75] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video
gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended to compete with the
Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[76] In April 2018, a shooting occurred at YouTube's headquarters in San
Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted in the death of the shooter.[77]
By February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours
worth of videos were uploaded every minute.[8][78] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than
500 hours per minute.[9] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-athome orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased. Forbes estimated that YouTube
accounted for 16% of all internet traffic, as of 2024, up from 11% in 2018, before the pandemic.[79][80] In
response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth to make sure medical entities had
sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix said they would reduce streaming quality
for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's
request.[81] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: "We continue
to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize
stress on the system during this unprecedented situation."[82]
After a 2018 complaint alleging violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[83]
the company was fined $170 million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under
the age of 13.[84] YouTube was also ordered to create systems to increase children's privacy.[85][86]
Following criticisms of its implementation of those systems, YouTube started treating all videos
designated as "made for kids" as liable under COPPA on January 6, 2020.[87][88] Joining the YouTube
Kids app, the company created a supervised mode, designed more for tweens, in 2021.[89] Additionally, to
compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels, YouTube released YouTube Shorts, a short-form video
platform.[90] During that period, YouTube entered disputes with other tech companies. For over a year, in
2018–19, no YouTube app was available for Amazon Fire products.[91] In 2020, Roku removed the
YouTube TV app from its streaming store after the two companies were unable to reach an agreement.[92]
After testing earlier in 2021, YouTube removed public display of dislike counts on videos in November
2021, claiming the reason for the removal was, based on its internal research, that users often used the
dislike feature as a form of cyberbullying and brigading.[93] While some users praised the move as a way
to discourage trolls, others felt that hiding dislikes would make it harder for viewers to recognize
clickbait or unhelpful videos and that other features already existed for creators to limit bullying.
YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim referred to the update as "a stupid idea", and said that the real reason
behind the change was "not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed." He felt that users'
ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, "The process works, and
there's a name for it: the wisdom of the crowds. The process breaks when the platform interferes with it.
Then, the platform invariably declines."[94][95][96] Shortly after the announcement, software developer
Dmitry Selivanov created Return YouTube Dislike, an open-source, third-party browser extension for
Chrome and Firefox that allows users to see a video's number of dislikes.[97] In a letter published on

January 25, 2022, by then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, acknowledged that removing public dislike
counts was a controversial decision, but reiterated that she stands by this decision, claiming that "it
reduced dislike attacks."[98]
In 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer
videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the
beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads,
YouTube "ended" the experiment on September 19 of the same year.[99] In October, YouTube announced
that they would be rolling out customizable user handles in addition to channel names, which would also
become channel URLs.[100]

Neal Mohan leadership (2023–present)
On February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would
step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor.
Wojcicki took on an advisory role for Google and parent

company Alphabet.[101] Wojcicki died a year and a half later

In
late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use
of ad blockers on the platform. Users of ad blockers may be
given a pop-up warning saying "Video player will be blocked after 3 videos". Users of ad blockers are
shown a message asking them to allow ads or inviting them to subscribe to the ad-free YouTube Premium
subscription plan. YouTube says that the use of ad blockers violates its terms of service.[103][104] In April
2024, YouTube announced it would be "strengthening our enforcement on third-party apps that violate
YouTube's Terms of Service, specifically ad-blocking apps".[105] Starting in June 2024, Google Chrome
announced that it would be replacing Manifest V2 in favor of Manifest V3, effectively killing support for
most ad-blockers.[106] Around the same time, YouTube started using server-side ad injection, which
allows the platform to inject the ads directly into the video, instead of having the ad as a separate file
which can be blocked.[107]
In September 2023, YouTube announced an in-app gaming platform called Playables. It was made
accessible to all users in May 2024, expanding from an initial offering limited to premium subscribers. In
December 2024, YouTube began testing a new multiplayer feature for that service, supporting multiplayer
functionality across desktop and mobile devices. As of December 2024 the Playables catalog has over
130 games in various genres, including trivia, action and sports.[108][109] In December 2024, YouTube
introduced new guidelines prohibiting videos with clickbait titles to enhance content quality and combat
misinformation. The platform aims to penalize creators using misleading or sensationalized titles, with
potential actions including video removal or channel suspension.[110] According to YouTube, this
guideline will gradually roll out in India first, but will expand to more countries in the coming
months.[111]
On February 14, 2025, YouTube celebrated 20 years since its founding.[112] On July 30, 2025, amid the
implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023 in the United Kingdom, Google announced that it would
begin to enforce "age assurance" policies for selected users in the United States as a trial. Machine
learning will be used to determine the age of the user (regardless of any account information indicating
their age) and restrict access to certain content and features across all Google properties, including
YouTube (including, in particular, disabling personalized advertising and enabling certain digital

wellbeing limits), if they are assumed to be under 18. On YouTube, this will be based on factors such as
searches and video history, and the age of the account. The user must go through age verification via
payment, scanned ID, or selfie to access all features if they are detected to be a minor.[113][114] On April
9, 2025, YouTube expressed support for the NO FAKES Act of 2025, introduced by Senator Chris Coons
(D-DE) and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and announced an expansion of its pilot program that is
designed to identify content generated by AI.[115]
On September 23, 2025, YouTube parent company Alphabet announced that it would reinstate creators
that were banned for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and the 2020 U.S. presidential
election.[116] Within the context of the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel and debates about free speech in the
United States, Vice President JD Vance defended Kimmel's suspension and instead cited a letter sent by
Alphabet legal counsel Daniel F. Donovan to U.S. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan,
claiming the Biden administration pressured YouTube to remove "non-violative user-generated content"
containing misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, and announced that it
would reinstate content creators previously banned due to the cited content;[117][118] however, such
claims have not formally been proven, and the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed in 2024 the First
Amendment case Murthy v. Missouri (which claimed the Biden administration had pressured social media
companies to censor conservative views, government criticism, and COVID-19 misinformation), ruling
6–3 that neither the attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana nor other respondents had standing to
bring the case. The decision of Alphabet to bring back YouTube creators who engaged in misinformation
was criticized for prioritizing "free expression" over "facts".[119]

Senior leadership
YouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the
company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar
took over Hurley's position and kept the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later
resigned in 2023.[101] On February 16, 2023, Neal Mohan was appointed as the new CEO.[101]

Features
YouTube offers different features based on user verification, such as standard or basic features like
uploading videos, creating playlists, and using YouTube Music, with limits based on daily activity
(verification via phone number or channel history increases feature availability and daily usage limits);
intermediate or additional features like longer videos (over 15 minutes), live streaming, custom
thumbnails, and creating podcasts; advanced features like content ID appeals, embedding live streams,
applying for monetization, clickable links, adding chapters, and pinning comments on videos or
posts.[120]

Videos
In January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the
site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television.[121] In
2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.[122] In

December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and Sony music
videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by The Daily Dot that the views had been deleted due to a
violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts.
That was disputed by Billboard, which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the
videos were no longer active on YouTube.[123][124]
On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behavior which caused a video's view count
to freeze at "301" (later "301+") until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud.[125]
YouTube view counts again began updating in real time.[126] Since September 2019, subscriber counts
are abbreviated. Only three leading digits of channels' subscriber counts are indicated publicly,
compromising the function of third-party real-time indicators such as Social Blade. Exact counts remain
available to channel operators inside YouTube Studio.[127]
On November 11, 2021, after testing out this change in March of the same year, YouTube announced it
would start hiding dislike counts on videos, making them invisible to viewers. The company stated the
decision was in response to experiments which confirmed that smaller YouTube creators were more likely
to be targeted in dislike brigading and harassment. Creators will still be able to see the number of likes
and dislikes in the YouTube Studio dashboard tool, according to YouTube.[128][129][130] YouTube has an
estimated 14.8 billion videos with about 4% of those never having a view.[11] Just over 85% have fewer
than 1,000 views.[131]

Copyright issues
YouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including
the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns.[132] At
the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright
laws.[133] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube.
YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a
DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation
Act. Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike. Three
successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all
of its uploaded videos being deleted.[134][135] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom,
Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done
too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.[136][137][138]
In August 2008, a US court ruled in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. that copyright holders cannot order
the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the
material.[139] YouTube's owner Google announced in November 2015 that they would help cover the
legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use defenses apply.[140] In the 2011 case of Smith v.
Summit Entertainment LLC, professional singer Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful
use of copyright takedown notices on YouTube.[141] He asserted seven causes of action, and four were
ruled in Smith's favor.[142] In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held
responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users.[143] On November 1, 2016, the dispute with
GEMA was resolved, with Google content ID being used to allow advertisements to be added to videos
with content protected by GEMA.[144]

In April 2013, it was reported that Universal Music Group and YouTube have a contractual agreement
that prevents content blocked on YouTube by a request from UMG from being restored, even if the
uploader of the video files a DMCA counter-notice.[145][146] As part of YouTube Music, Universal and
YouTube signed an agreement in 2017, which was followed by separate agreements other major labels,
which gave the company the right to advertising revenue when its music was played on YouTube.[147] By
2019, creators were having videos taken down or demonetized when Content ID identified even short
segments of copyrighted music within a much longer video, with different levels of enforcement
depending on the record label.[148] Experts noted that some of these clips said qualified for fair use.[148]
Content ID
In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe
copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the
one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to
distribute.[149] The system, which was initially called "Video Identification"[150][151] and later became
known as Content ID,[152] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a
database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright
violation if a match is found.[153] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the
video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the
video.
An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that
while the system was "surprisingly resilient" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos,
it was not infallible.[154] The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy
in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.[155] If a YouTube user
disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.[156] Before
2016, videos were not monetized until the dispute was resolved. Since April 2016, videos continue to be
monetized while the dispute is in progress, and the money goes to whoever won the dispute.[157] Should
the uploader want to monetize the video again, they may remove the disputed audio in the "Video
Manager".[158] YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's
rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.[159]

Russia
In 2021, two accounts linked to RT DE, the German channel of the Russian state-owned RT network,
were removed for breaching YouTube's policies relating to COVID-19.[160] Russia threatened to ban
YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021.[161] Shortly after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, YouTube removed all channels funded by the Russian state.[162]
YouTube expanded the removal of Russian content from its site to include channels described as 'proRussian'. In June 2022, the War Gonzo channel run by Russian military blogger and journalist Semyon
Pegov was deleted.[163]
In July 2023, YouTube removed the channel of British journalist Graham Phillips, active in covering the
war in Donbas from 2014.[164] In August 2023, a Moscow court fined Google 3 million rubles, around
$35,000, for not deleting what it said was "fake news about the war in Ukraine".[165] In October 2024, a
Russian court fined Google 2 undecillion rubles (equivalent to US$20 decillion) for restricting Russian
state media channels on YouTube.[166] State news agency TASS reported that Google is allowed to return

to the Russian market only if it complies with the court's decision.[167] Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry
Peskov labeled the court decision as "symbolic" and warned Google that it "should not be restricting the
actions of our broadcasters on its platform."[168]

April Fools gags
YouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016. In 2008,
all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video "Never Gonna Give You
Up", a prank known as "rickrolling".[169][170] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page,
the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a "new layout".[171] In 2010, YouTube
temporarily released a "TEXTp" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters "in order to
reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second."[172]
The next year, the site celebrated its "100th anniversary" with a range of sepia-toned silent, early 1900sstyle films, including a parody of Keyboard Cat.[173] In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the
site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on
DVD.[174] In 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company The Onion to claim in an
uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an
end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning
video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two
presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[175][176]
In 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and
revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as "Clocking", "Kissing Dad", and "Glub Glub Water
Dance".[177] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from
"Sandstorm" by Darude.[178] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the
platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[179]

Services
YouTube Premium
YouTube Premium (formerly Music Key and YouTube Red)
is YouTube's premium subscription service. It offers
advertising-free streaming, access to original programming,
Logo of YouTube Premium
and background and offline video playback on mobile
devices.[180] YouTube Premium was originally announced on
November 12, 2014, as "Music Key", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to
integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music "All Access" service.[181][182][183] On October
28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access
to exclusive original content.[184][185][186] As of November 2016, the service has 1.5 million subscribers,
with a further million on a free-trial basis.[187] As of June 2017, the first season of YouTube Originals had
received 250 million views in total.[188]

YouTube Kids
YouTube Kids is an American children's video app developed
by YouTube, a subsidiary of Google. The app was developed
in response to parental and government scrutiny on the
Logo of YouTube Kids
content available to children. The app provides a version of
the service oriented towards children, with curated selections
of content, parental control features, and filtering of videos deemed inappropriate viewing for children
aged under 13, 8 or 5, depending on the age grouping chosen. First released on February 15, 2015, as an
Android and iOS mobile app, the app has since been released for LG, Samsung, and Sony smart TVs, as
well as for Android TV. On May 27, 2020, it became available on Apple TV. As of September 2019, the
app is available in 69 countries, including Hong Kong and Macau, and one province. YouTube launched a
web-based version of YouTube Kids on August 30, 2019.[189]

YouTube Music
On September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the cofounder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music
Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[190] In early
2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of
YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a
Logo of YouTube Music
platform that would compete with other services such as
Spotify and Apple Music.[191] On May 22, 2018, the music
streaming platform named "YouTube Music" was launched for people who mostly listen to music on
YouTube.[192][193][194]

YouTube Movies & TV
YouTube Movies & TV is a video on demand (VOD) service that offers movies and television shows for
purchase or rental, depending on availability, along with a selection of movies (encompassing between
100 and 500 titles overall) that are free to stream, with interspersed ad breaks. YouTube began offering
free-to-view movie titles to its users in November 2018; selections of new movies are added and others
removed, unannounced each month.[195] In March 2021, Google announced plans to gradually deprecate
the Google Play Movies & TV app, and eventually migrate all users to the YouTube app's Movies & TV
store to view, rent and purchase movies and TV shows (first affecting Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio
smart TV users on July 15).[196][197] Google Play Movies & TV formally shut down on January 17, 2024,
with the web version of that platform migrated to YouTube as an expansion of the Movies & TV store to
desktop users. Other functions of Google Play Movies & TV were integrated into the Google TV
service.[198]
YouTube Primetime Channels
On November 1, 2022, YouTube launched Primetime Channels, a channel store platform offering thirdparty subscription streaming add-ons sold a la carte through the YouTube website and app, competing
with similar subscription add-on stores operated by Apple, Prime Video and Roku. The add-ons can be
purchased through the YouTube Movies & TV hub or through the official YouTube channels of the

available services; subscribers of YouTube TV add-ons that are sold through Primetime Channels can also
access their content via the YouTube app and website. A total of 34 streaming services (including
Paramount+, Showtime, Starz, MGM+, AMC+ and ViX+) were initially available for purchase.[199][200]
NFL Sunday Ticket, as part of a broader residential distribution deal with Google signed in December
2022 that also made it available to YouTube TV subscribers, was added to Primetime Channels as a
standalone add-on on August 16, 2023.[201][202] The ad-free tier of Max was added to Primetime
Channels on December 12, 2023, coinciding with YouTube TV converting its separate HBO (for base
plan subscribers) and HBO Max (for all subscribers) linear/VOD add-ons into a single combined Max
offering.[203][204][note 1]

YouTube TV
On February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at
YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube
TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that
Logo of YouTube TV
would be available for United States customers at a price of
US$65 per month. Initially launching in five major markets
(New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017,[205][206] the
service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW,
Fox and NBC, along with selected MyNetworkTV affiliates and independent stations in certain markets),
as well as approximately 60 cable channels owned by companies such as The Walt Disney Company,
Paramount Global, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Allen Media Group and Warner Bros. Discovery
(including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox
Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN).[207][208]
Subscribers can receive premium cable channels (including HBO (via a combined Max add-on that
includes in-app and log-in access to the service), Cinemax, Showtime, Starz and MGM+) and other
subscription services (such as NFL Sunday Ticket, MLB.tv, NBA League Pass, Curiosity Stream and Fox
Nation) as optional add-ons for an extra fee, and can access YouTube Premium original content.[207][208]
In September 2022, YouTube TV began allowing customers to purchase most of its premium add-ons
(excluding certain services such as NBA League Pass and AMC+) without an existing subscription to its
base package.[209]

YouTube Go
In September 2016, YouTube Go was announced,[210] as an
Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on
mobile devices in emerging markets. It was distinct from the
Logo of YouTube Go
company's main Android app and allowed videos to be
downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users
to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data
control and video resolution.[211]
In February 2017, YouTube Go was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other
countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South
Africa.[212][213] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil,

Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's
population.[214][215] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down YouTube Go in
August 2022.[216]

YouTube Shorts
In September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be
launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second
videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts.[217][218]
The platform was tested in India and later expanded to other
countries, including the United States in March 2021, with
videos allowed up to 1 minute long.[219] The platform is not a
standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app.
Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools,
including the possibility of adding licensed music to their
videos.[220] The platform had its global beta launch on July
13, 2021.[221] On October 15, 2024, the platform officially
extended the length of shorts to 3 minutes.[222]

YouTube Stories
In 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called
"YouTube Reels".[223] The feature was nearly identical to
Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories. YouTube later
renamed the feature "YouTube Stories". It was only available
to creators who had more than 10,000 subscribers and could
only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app.[224] On May
25, 2023, YouTube announced that they would be shutting
down this feature on June 26, 2023.[225][226]

YouTube VR

Space Station

In November 2016, YouTube released YouTube VR, a
dedicated version with an interface for VR devices, for Google's Daydream mobile VR platform on
Android.[227] In November 2018, YouTube VR was released on the Oculus Store for the Oculus Go
headset.[227] YouTube VR was updated since for compatibility with successive Quest devices, and was
ported to Pico 4.[228]
YouTube VR allows for access to all YouTube-hosted videos, but particularly supports headset access for
360° and 180°-degree video (both in 2D and stereoscopic 3D). Starting with the Oculus Quest, the app
was updated for compatibility with mixed-reality passthrough modes on VR headsets. In April 2024,
YouTube VR was updated to support 8K SDR video on Meta Quest 3.[229]

Playables
In 2010, YouTube added Snake as a hidden game inside of their video player.[230] In May 2024, YouTube
introduced Playables, a set of around 75 free-to-play games that can be played on the platform.[231]

Automatic language dubbing
In December 2024, YouTube added the functionality of automatic language dubbing, which uses AI to
produce translations of videos into different languages.[232][233][234][235]

Criticism and controversies
YouTube, a video sharing platform, has faced various criticisms over the years, particularly regarding
content moderation, offensive content, and monetization. YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its
operations,[236] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and
falsehoods,[237] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive
content involving popular characters,[238] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their
comment sections,[239] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized
with advertising.[236]
YouTube has also been blocked by several countries. As of 2018, public access to YouTube was blocked
by countries including China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[240] Uzbekistan,[241][242] Tajikistan,
Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan.

Privacy concerns
Since its founding in 2005, the American video-sharing website YouTube has been faced with a growing
number of privacy issues, including allegations that it allows users to upload unauthorized copyrighted
material and allows personal information from young children to be collected without their parents'
consent.
In September 2024, the Federal Trade Commission released a report summarizing 9 company responses
(including from YouTube) to orders made by the agency pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914 to provide information about user and non-user data collection (including of
children and teenagers) and data use by the companies that found that the companies' user and non-user
data practices put individuals vulnerable to identity theft, stalking, unlawful discrimination, emotional
distress and mental health issues, social stigma, and reputational harm.[243][244][245]

Censorship and bans
State censorship of YouTube content
YouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including:[246]
Limiting public access and exposure to content that may ignite social or political unrest.
Preventing criticism of a ruler (e.g. in North Korea), government (e.g. in China) or its actions
(e.g. in Morocco), government officials (e.g. in Turkey and Libya), or religion (e.g. in
Pakistan).
Morality-based laws, e.g. in Iran.
Access to specific videos is sometimes prevented due to copyright and intellectual property protection
laws (e.g. in Germany), violations of hate speech, and preventing access to videos judged inappropriate
for youth,[247] which is also done by YouTube with the YouTube Kids app and with "restricted

mode".[248] Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social
media sites, including YouTube, due to its bandwidth limitations[249][250] and the site's potential for
distraction.[246][251]
As of 2018, public access to YouTube is blocked by China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan,[252]
Uzbekistan,[253][254] Tajikistan, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. In some countries, YouTube is blocked
for more limited periods of time, such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in
response to upcoming political anniversaries. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular
video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.[246]
Reports emerged that since October 2019, comments posted with Chinese characters insulting the
Chinese Communist Party (
"communist bandit" or
"50 Cent Party", referring to statesponsored commentators) were being automatically deleted within 15 seconds.[255] Specific incidents
where YouTube has been blocked include:

共匪

五毛

Thailand blocked access in April 2007 over a video said to be insulting the Thai king.[256]
Morocco blocked access in May 2007, possibly as a result of videos critical of Morocco's
occupation of Western Sahara.[257] YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007,
after Maroc Telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a
mere "technical glitch".[258]
Turkey blocked access between 2008 and 2010 after controversy over videos deemed
insulting to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.[259][260][261] In November 2010, a video of the Turkish
politician Deniz Baykal caused the site to be blocked again briefly, and the site was
threatened with a new shutdown if it did not remove the video.[262] During the two and a
half-year block of YouTube, the video-sharing website remained the eighth-most-accessed
site in Turkey.[263][264] In 2014, Turkey blocked the access for the second time, after "a highlevel intelligence leak".[265][266][267]
Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, because of "offensive material" towards the
Islamic faith, including display of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.[268] This led to a near
global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was
inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after
the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers at the request of the
government.[269][270] Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual
private network software.[271] In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,
Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing "growing sacrilegious content".[272] The
ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from
its servers at the request of the government. However, individual videos deemed offensive
to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked.[273][274] Pakistan again placed a
ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film Innocence of
Muslims. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific
version.[275]
Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, because of videos that featured demonstrations
in the city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996,
and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking
was criticized by Human Rights Watch.[276] In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War,
YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.[277]
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sudan blocked access in September 2012
following controversy over a 14-minute trailer for the film Innocence of Muslims which had
been posted on the site.[278][279][280][281][282] A court in the southern Russian Republic of
Chechnya ruled that Innocence of Muslims should be banned.[283] In Libya and Egypt, it

was blamed for violent protests. YouTube stated: "This video—which is widely available on
the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube. However, given the
very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both
countries."[284][285]
Bans by YouTube
Following U.S. government foreign policy decisions, YouTube has censored content posted by a number
of organizations:
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube announced on March
1 the immediate removal of RT (and other Russian government-funded outlets) from its
platform in Europe. The removal was soon expanded globally.[286] From late 2024, users
across Russia started experiencing sharp declines in YouTube loading speeds.[287]
YouTube removed the videos and deleted the accounts of three Human Rights
Organizations that document the human toll of the Gaza War. In early October 2025,
complying with Trump Administration sanctions against three of the leading Palestinian
human rights groups, Al-Haq based in the West Bank, the Al Mezan Center for Human
Rights based in Gaza, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights also based in Gaza,
YouTube removed 700 videos and the accounts of these organizations. The videos included
an investigation uncovering Israel's role in the killing of a Palestinian American journalist
Shireen Abu Akleh, a video documenting Israel's destruction of Palestinian homes in the
West Bank, a video of mothers in Gaza who survived Israel's attacks, and testimonies of
Palestinian detainees tortured in Israel. The Trump Administration has also sanctioned the
International Criminal Court (ICC), which has indicted senior Israeli officials for war crimes in
Gaza, ICC court officials, and anyone accused of aiding their efforts. Earlier in 2025,
YouTube shuttered the account and removed the videos of the Addameer Prisoner Support
and Human Rights Association, a Palestinian Non-Government Organization (NGO) that
monitors the treatment of Palestinian detainees arrested in the West Bank.[288]

Social impact
Private individuals,[289] as well as large production corporations,[290] have used YouTube to grow their
audiences. Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or
effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic.[289] Concurrently, old media celebrities
moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators
accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by
television.[290] While YouTube's revenue-sharing "Partner Program" made it possible to earn a substantial
living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually[291]
and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million[292]—in 2012 CMU
business editor characterized YouTube as "a free-to-use ... promotional platform for the music
labels."[293] In 2013, Katheryn Thayer of Forbes asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of
high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.[294] Videos of the 2.5%
of artists categorized as "mega", "mainstream" and "mid-sized" received 90.3% of the relevant views on
YouTube and Vevo in that year.[295] By early 2013, Billboard had announced that it was factoring
YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts.[296]
Observing that face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been "fine-tuned by
millions of years of evolution", TED curator Chris Anderson referred to several YouTube contributors and
asserted that "what Gutenberg did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face

communication."[297] Anderson asserted that it is not far-fetched to say
that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that
video contributors may be about to launch "the biggest learning cycle in
human history."[297] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew
from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin
into what Forbes' Michael Noer called "the largest school in the world",
with technology poised to disrupt how people learn.[298] YouTube was
awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award,[299] the website being
described as a Speakers' Corner that "both embodies and promotes
democracy".[300] The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate
share of YouTube's most-subscribed channels feature minorities,
contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely
white.[301] A Pew Research Center study reported the development of
"visual journalism", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news
organizations share in content creation.[302] The study also concluded
that YouTube was becoming an important platform by which people
acquire news.[303]

Annual Peabody Awards
accepting for YouTube

YouTube has enabled people to more directly engage with government, such as in the CNN/YouTube
presidential debates (2007) in which ordinary people submitted questions to U.S. presidential candidates
via YouTube video, with a techPresident co-founder saying that Internet video was changing the political
landscape.[304] Describing the Arab Spring (2010–2012), sociologist Philip N. Howard quoted an
activist's succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using "Facebook to schedule
the protests, Twitter to coordinate, and YouTube to tell the world."[305] In 2012, more than a third of the
U.S. Senate introduced a resolution condemning Joseph Kony 16 days after the "Kony 2012" video was
posted to YouTube, with resolution co-sponsor Senator Lindsey Graham remarking that the video "will do
more to lead to (Kony's) demise than all other action combined."[306]
Conversely, YouTube has also allowed government to
more easily engage with citizens, the White House's
official YouTube channel being the seventh top news
organization producer on YouTube in 2012[309] and in
2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama
impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video
spoof to encourage young Americans to enroll in the
Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health
insurance.[310] In February 2014, U.S. President Obama
Prominent YouTube content creators met at the
held a meeting at the White House with leading
White House with U.S. President Obama to
YouTube content creators not only to promote
discuss how government could better connect
awareness of Obamacare[311] but more generally to
with the "YouTube generation".[307][308]
develop ways for government to better connect with the
"YouTube Generation".[307] Whereas YouTube's
inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube
content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting
content and fickle audience.[307]

Some YouTube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events, such as Innocence of Muslims
(2012) which spurred protests and related anti-American violence internationally.[312] TED curator Chris
Anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field
share their independently developed skills in YouTube videos, thus challenging others to improve their
own skills, and spurring invention and evolution in that field.[297] Journalist Virginia Heffernan stated in
The New York Times that such videos have "surprising implications" for the dissemination of culture and
even the future of classical music.[313]
A 2017 article in The New York Times Magazine posited that YouTube had become "the new talk radio"
for the far right.[314] Almost a year before YouTube's January 2019 announcement that it would begin a
"gradual change" of "reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform
users in harmful ways",[315] Zeynep Tufekci had written in The New York Times that, "(g)iven its billion
or so users, YouTube may be one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century".[316]
Under YouTube's changes to its recommendation engine, the most-recommended channel evolved from
conspiracy theorist Alex Jones (2016) to Fox News (2019).[317] According to a 2020 study, viewership of
far-right videos on YouTube peaked in 2017 and "a growing body of journalistic evidence" suggested that
YouTube was radicalizing young men through its recommendation engine, but that such evidence was
"fraught with a bias towards sensationalism". It also found more "mainstream-adjacent Conservative
creators" gaining over alt-right and extremist videos by 2020.[318] A 2022 study found that "despite
widespread concerns that YouTube's algorithms send people down 'rabbit holes' with recommendations to
extremist videos, little systematic evidence exists to support this conjecture", and that such exposure was
"heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial
resentment."[319] A 2024 study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found that YouTube frequently
recommended Christian videos and right-leaning and culturally conservative "culture war" videos by Fox
News and male lifestyle influencers to accounts that did not show an interest in such topics.[320]
The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers[321] and the YouTube Symphony Orchestra[322] selected their
membership based on individual video performances.[297][322] Further, the cyber-collaboration charity
video "We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube edition)" was formed by mixing performances of 57
globally distributed singers into a single musical work,[323] with The Tokyo Times noting the "We Pray for
You" YouTube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable
purposes.[324] The anti-bullying It Gets Better Project expanded from a single YouTube video directed to
discouraged or suicidal LGBT teens,[325] that within two months drew video responses from hundreds
including U.S. President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden, White House staff, and several cabinet
secretaries.[326] Similarly, in response to fifteen-year-old Amanda Todd's video "My story: Struggling,
bullying, suicide, self-harm", legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to
study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy.[327] In May 2018, after
London Metropolitan Police claimed that drill music videos glamorizing violence gave rise to gang
violence, YouTube deleted 30 videos.[328]

Finances
Prior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's
revenues in 2007 were noted as "not material" in a regulatory filing.[329] In June 2008, a Forbes
magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales.[330] In
2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion.[331] In 2013, it nearly

doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to e-Marketer,[331][332] while others estimated
$4.7 billion.[331] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by
advertising.[66] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices
ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month.[333] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other
providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.[66]
Google first published exact revenue numbers for YouTube in February 2020 as part of Alphabet's 2019
financial report. According to Google, YouTube had made US$15.1 billion in ad revenue in 2019, in
contrast to US$8.1 billion in 2017 and US$11.1 billion in 2018. YouTube's revenues made up nearly 10%
of the total Alphabet revenue in 2019.[334][335] These revenues accounted for approximately 20 million
subscribers combined between YouTube Premium and YouTube Music subscriptions, and 2 million
subscribers to YouTube TV.[336] YouTube had $29.2 billion ads revenue in 2022, up by $398 million from
the prior year.[337] In Q2 2024, ad revenue rose to $8.66 billion, up 13% on Q1.[338]

Partnership with corporations
YouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[339] In March
2007, it struck a deal with the BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for
entertainment.[340] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate
Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the
site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called "Shows". The move was
intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and
Disney.[341][342] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of "Shows" available to UK viewers,
offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[343] In January 2010, YouTube
introduced a film rentals service,[344] available in many countries, and TV shows can be bought in several
countries.[345][346] The service offers over 6,000 films.[347]
2017 advertiser boycott
In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube,
after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded
assurances that its advertising would "be delivered safely and appropriately". The Guardian newspaper,
as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in
response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had "begun an
extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes
that give brands more control over where their ads appear".[348][349]
In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street
Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video
containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not
earned any ad revenue for the uploader. The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been
triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video.[350][351] On April 6, 2017, YouTube announced
that to "ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules", it would change its practices
to require that a channel undergo a policy compliance review, and have at least 10,000-lifetime views,
before they may join the YouTube Partner Program.[352]

YouTuber earnings
In May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program
(YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the
uploader of the video to share the revenue produced
by advertising on the site.[353] YouTube typically
takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from
videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent
going to the uploader.[354][355] There are over two
million members of the YouTube Partner
Program.[356] According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a
Total annual earnings of the top ten YouTuber
pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is
accounts, and the income of the single highestshown before the video starts) cost advertisers on
earning account for 2017
average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually, no more
than half of the eligible videos have a pre-roll
advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers.[357]
YouTube's policies restrict certain forms of content from being included in videos being monetized with
advertising, including videos containing violence, strong language, sexual content, "controversial or
sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and
tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown" (unless the content is "usually newsworthy or comedic
and the creator's intent is to inform or entertain"),[358] and videos whose user comments contain
"inappropriate" content.[359]
In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid
subscription for viewers to watch videos.[360][361] In April 2017, YouTube set an eligibility requirement
of 10,000 lifetime views for a paid subscription.[362] On January 16, 2018, the eligibility requirement for
monetization was changed to 4,000 hours of watch-time within the past 12 months and 1,000
subscribers.[362] The move was seen as an attempt to ensure that videos being monetized did not lead to
controversy, but was criticized for penalizing smaller YouTube channels.[363] YouTube Play Buttons, a
part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels.[364]
The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, silver plated metal, ruby, and
red tinted crystal glass are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million,
fifty million subscribers, and one hundred million subscribers, respectively.[365][366]
YouTube's policies on "advertiser-friendly content" restrict what may be incorporated into videos being
monetized; this includes strong violence, language,[367] sexual content, and "controversial or sensitive
subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies,
even if graphic imagery is not shown", unless the content is "usually newsworthy or comedic and the
creator's intent is to inform or entertain".[368] In September 2016, after introducing an enhanced
notification system to inform users of these violations, YouTube's policies were criticized by prominent
users, including Philip DeFranco and Vlogbrothers. DeFranco argued that not being able to earn
advertising revenue on such videos was "censorship by a different name". A YouTube spokesperson stated
that while the policy itself was not new, the service had "improved the notification and appeal process to
ensure better communication to our creators".[369][370][371] Boing Boing reported in 2019 that LGBT
keywords resulted in demonetization.[372] In the United States as of November 2020, and June 2021
worldwide,[373] YouTube reserves the right to monetize any video on the platform, even if their uploader

is not a member of the YouTube Partner Program. This will occur on channels whose content is deemed
"advertiser-friendly", and all revenue will go directly to Google without any share given to the
uploader.[374]

Revenue to copyright holders
The majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the
rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue.[375] In 2010, it was reported that nearly
a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders.
YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue
running for revenue.[376] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming
the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games.[377] In February 2015,
Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators
Program.[378][379][380] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the
Creators program. Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019.[381][382]
